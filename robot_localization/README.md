## Probabilities
### Quantifying Certainty and Uncertainty
When we talk about being certain that a robot is at a certain location (x, y), moving a certain direction, or sensing a certain environment, we can quantify that certainty using probabilistic quantities. Sensor measurements and movement all have some uncertainty associated with them (ex. a speedometer that reads 50mph may be off by a few mph, depending on whether a car is moving up or down hill).

### Bayes' Rule
Bayes' Rule is extremely important in robotics and it can be summarized in one sentence: given an initial prediction, if we gather additional data (data that our initial prediction depends on), we can improve that prediction!

#### Initial Scenario

Map of the road and the initial location prediction.

We know a little bit about the map of the road that a car is on (pictured above). We also have an initial GPS measurement; the GPS signal says the car is at the red dot. However, this GPS measurement is inaccurate up to about 5 meters. So, the vehicle could be located anywhere within a 5m radius circle around the dot.

#### Sensors
Then we gather data from the car's sensors. Self-driving cars mainly use three types of sensors to observe the world:

- Camera, which records video,
- Lidar, which is a light-based sensor, and
- Radar, which uses radio waves.

All of these sensors detect surrounding objects and scenery.

Autonomous cars also have lots of **internal sensors** that measure things like the speed and direction of the car's movement, the orientation of its wheels, and even the internal temperature of the car!

##### Sensor Measurements
Suppose that our sensors detect some details about the terrain and the way our car is moving, specifically:

- The car could be anywhere within the GPS 5m radius circle,
- The car is moving upwards on this road,
- There is a tree to the left of our car, and
- The carâ€™s wheels are pointing to the right.

Knowing only these sensor measurements, examine the map below and answer the following quiz question.

We can use sensor data to improve our estimates of car location using Baye's rule. 

### What is a Probability Distribution?
Probability distributions allow you to represent the probability of an event using a mathematical equation. Like any mathematical equation:

- probability distributions can be **visualized** using a graph especially in 2-dimensional cases.
- probability distributions can be **worked with using algebra, linear algebra and calculus**.

These distributions make it much easier to understand and summarize the probability of a system whether that system be a coin flip experiment or the location of an autonomous vehicle.

### Types of Probability Distributions
Probability distributions are really helpful for understanding the probability of a system. Looking at the big pictures, there are two types of probability distributions:

- discrete probability distributions
- continuous probability distributions
Before we get into the details about what discrete and continuous mean, take a look at these two visualizations below. The first image shows a discrete probability distribution and the second a continuous probability distribution. What is similar and what is different about each visualization?

### Localization Summary

#### Sense/Move Cycle
1. When a robot senses, a **measurement update** happens; this is a simple multiplication that is based off of Bayes' rule, which says that we can update our belief based on measurements! This step was also followed by a **normalization** that made sure the resultant distribution was still vald (and added up to 1).
2. When it moves, a **motion update** or prediction step occurs; this step is a convolution that shifts the distribution in the direction of motion.

After this cycle, we are left with an altered **posterior** distribution!
